# Shipping AI

"Shipping AI" is a project designed to create intelligent shipping copilots that facilitate recommendations and customization in the package shipping process. This project is aimed at both online sellers and office shippers, allowing them to manage their shipments efficiently and accurately.

The system combines several advanced technologies to offer a comprehensive solution that includes automatic package dimension detection, shipping cost calculation, and an intuitive, guided user interface.




## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, Vite, Zustand, Socket.io, react-print

**Backend:** ExpressJS , Python 

## Microsoft Azure Services

Azure Custom Vision (for object detection)
Azure Machine Learning (for automated shipping cost calculation)


## Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajax159/HackatonShippingAi.git
cd HackatonShippingAi
```
## Backend Setup (Python)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Frontend Setup (ReactJS)
```bash
cd ../frontend

npm install
```


## Usage

```javascript
Package Scanning:

Start scanning the package using the user interface.
Arrange the package until the yellow contour lines appear.
Calculate the package dimensions and send the image to the Azure Custom Vision model.
Stop the scan once the dimensions are obtained.
Details Entry:

Fill in the weight and customer details fields.
Select the shipping origin and destination, reviewing the drawn route.
Choose the type of transport, noting that it affects the final cost.
Review and confirm order details.
Label Printing:

Print the generated label and attach it to the package for shipping.
```
